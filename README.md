# cpu_scheduling_algorithms

CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.

## Types of CPU scheduling Algorithm Included in this project:
- Preemptive Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling.
- Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling.
- Round Robin Scheduling.
- First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Python flet application.
